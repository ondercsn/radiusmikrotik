# radiusmikrotik
A browser based Radius manager with fully support of Mikrotik devices, FreeRadius, Asterisk PBX, Rsyslog. 

FreeRadius based Radius manager software. You can manage not only users and authenticate them, but all Mikrotik devices in your network
can be managed. Which device is down, what is signal levels, and all device informations can be viewed on user and access point screens. 

Your Asterisk PBX is integrated. You can list customer calls and listen voice records, list support demands etc.

Rsyslog is configured for ISP logs. 

Supports google maps. So you can locate your customers and access points with angular view according to beamwidth of Mikrotik devices. 

Using ticket system you can statistical follow customer faults, support demands, installations etc.

I think it will be a very good alternative for DMA Radius Manager and Daloradius 

I will upload the source files as soon as possible and will be glad if someones wants to participate to this project
